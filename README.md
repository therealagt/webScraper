# Web Scraper

This will be my first full stack project in GO.

I'm aiming for an efficient web scraper thats using Go's build in concurrency to scrape multiple sites at once including depth levels. So links on the given urls are beeing followed multiple levels down.

I'll be using postgreSQL to specify the scrape jobs and finally return the structured results.

UI is a simple SPA with some help of an agent, featuring basic buttons to initiate a new scrape and filter for more results.
