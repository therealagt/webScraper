# Web Scraper

This will be my first full stack project in GO.

I'm aiming for an efficient web scraper thats using Go's build in concurrency to scrape multiple sites at once.

I'll be using postgreSQL to specify the scrape jobs and finally return the structured results.

Finally there will be some kind of UI, probably in form of a simple dashboard in React, displaying the number of jobs, time spent while doing so etc..

Goal will be to run some basic price comparisons or maybe comparing subscription plans and content.
